# Jekyll Error Solution

## Problem
You're getting this error:
```
YAML Exception reading /github/workspace/src/layouts/Layout.astro: (<unknown>): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3 column 8 
ERROR: YOUR SITE COULD NOT BE BUILT:
Invalid YAML front matter in /github/workspace/src/pages/index.astro
```

## Root Cause
The error occurs because GitHub Pages is trying to process your Astro files with Jekyll instead of using your GitHub Actions workflow.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Repository Settings
Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Pages and ensure:
- **Source** is set to "GitHub Actions" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
- If it's set to "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

### 2. Check Workflow Status
- Go to your repository → Actions tab
- Look for any failed workflow runs with Jekyll errors
- Cancel any running Jekyll-based workflows
- Ensure only the `deploy.yml` workflow is running

### 3. Force a New Deployment
Since your current setup is correct, trigger a new deployment:

```bash
# Option 1: Push a small change
git add .
git commit -m "Force redeploy to fix Jekyll issue"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Manually trigger workflow
# Go to Actions → Deploy Astro site to Pages → Run workflow
```

### 4. Verify Files Are Correct
Your current setup is already correct:
- ✅ `deploy.yml` - Uses Astro build process
- ✅ `public/.nojekyll` - Disables Jekyll processing
- ✅ Workflow adds `.nojekyll` to dist folder
- ✅ Jekyll workflows are disabled

### 5. Clear GitHub Cache
Sometimes GitHub caches old configurations:
- Go to repository Settings → Actions → General
- Scroll to "Actions permissions" and save (even without changes)
- This can help clear cached workflow configurations

## Expected Result
After following these steps:
1. GitHub Pages will use GitHub Actions (not Jekyll)
2. Your Astro site will build successfully
3. The `.nojekyll` file will prevent Jekyll processing
4. Your site will deploy correctly

## Verification
Once deployed, check:
- Site loads correctly at your GitHub Pages URL
- No Jekyll processing errors in Actions logs
- Build process shows "Build with Astro" (not Jekyll)

## If Problem Persists
If you still see Jekyll errors:
1. Check if there are multiple repositories or branches
2. Verify you're looking at the correct repository's Actions
3. Ensure no other workflows are enabled
4. Contact GitHub support if the issue continues

The error you experienced was likely from an old workflow run or incorrect repository settings. Your current code and configuration are correct for Astro deployment.
