      "The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the probability distribution of the sum of a large number of independent random variables, each having a common mean and variance.",
      "Sampling refers to the process of selecting a subset (a sample) from a larger population to estimate characteristics of the entire population. There are various sampling methods such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, etc.",
      "Type I error (false positive) occurs when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, while Type II error (false negative) occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.",
      "Linear Regression is a statistical model used to analyze the linear relationship between two continuous variables. The P-value indicates the probability that the observed difference could have occurred by chance, Coefficient represents the strength and direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, and R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.",
      "Linear Regression assumes that the errors are normally distributed, independent, and have constant variance. It also assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables."

The study, based on interviews with 34 individuals across seven countries, examines motivations, key activities, and challenges associated with AI ethics auditing in the private sector. It finds that audits follow financial auditing stages but lack robust stakeholder involvement, measurement of success, and external reporting. Audits are primarily focused on technical AI ethics principles like bias, privacy, and explainability. The document also discusses the challenges faced by auditors, including competing demands, resource constraints, lack of technical infrastru...",
