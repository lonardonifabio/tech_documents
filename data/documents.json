The researcher collects images of fetal head abnormalities from a dataset, preprocesses them, and creates a dataframe for further analysis. The main objective is to classify the images into various categories such as 3D_Rendering, 3D_Volume_Rendering, Adaptive_Histogram_Equalization, Alpha_Blending, Basic_Color_Map, Contrast_Stretching, Edge_Detection, Gamma_Correction, Gaussian_Blur, Heatmap_Visualization, Interactive_Segmentation, LUT_Color_Map, and Random_Color_Palette. This work is significant for the medical field as it can aid in early detection and d...",
