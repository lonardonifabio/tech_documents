Achieving this requires investment in adequate resources to strengthen local and regional agency, and enhancing digital skills. It also requires addressing the continent’s dependency on other countries, extraction of material and human expertise and training data biases that misrepresent African contexts and perspectives. Though comprehensive AI regulation is still nascent in Africa, there is an increased focus on national AI strategies, ethical considerations, and responsible AI practices.",

Activation functions determine whether a neuron should be activated based on its weighted input and bias, introducing non-linearity into the network to enable it to learn complex patterns. The choice of activation function is crucial for optimizing network performance, with different functions having different properties suitable for various tasks. Linear activation functions are also covered, which apply only a direct scaling to the input without adding non-linearity.",

In an era where speed, eﬃciency, and customer centricity dictate market leadership, organisations need to harness every tool at their disposal. Over the past couple of years, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has exploded onto the world stage, with companies and individuals across the globe rapidly adopting the technology. The GCC is playing a lead role in the space, with business leaders in the region exploring ways of integrating this rapidly developing technology into their operations. Generative AI (GenAI) is being recognised as a game-changer for innovation in the region, empowering enterprises by automating routine tasks, enhancing customer experiences and assisting in critical decision-making processes. Insights from our 27th Annual CEO Survey: Middle East ﬁndings have shown that 73% of CEOs in the Middle East believe GenAI will signiﬁcantly change the way their company creates, delivers and captures value over the next three years1. GenAI is poised to make a signiﬁcant economic impact, with estimates indicating that it could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to global GDP across various industries by 2030.

    "summary": "Deep learning is the algorithm powering the current renaissance of artificial intelligence (AI). Its progress is not showing signs of slowing down. A McKinsey report estimates that by 2030, AI will potentially deliver $13 trillion to the global economy, or 16% of the world's current GDP. This opens up exciting career opportunities in the coming decade. However, deep learning can be daunting to learn. With the abundance of learning resources in recent years has emerged another problem - formation overload. This book aims to compress this knowledge and make the subject approachable. By the end of this book, you will be able to build a visual intuition about deep learning and neural networks.",

The rapid and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping workplaces, challenging traditional human –machine boundaries and redefining the knowledge, task, and social characteristics of work. GenAI can benefit workers by enhancing their productivity and performance, but it also poses psychological threats to workers' needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.",

But their remarkable feats trigger fear among some observers. Part of this fear nestles on the neck of survivalist insecurities, where it provokes the deep-seated question of what if ?

Major technology companies have attached themselves to this buzzword to receive capital investments, and every major technology company is pushing its even shinier parent artificial intelligence (AI). The reality is that Machine Learning as a concept is as old as computing itself. As early as 1950, Alan Turing was asking the question, “Can computers think?” In 1969, Arthur Samuel helped define machine learning specifically by stating, “[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” While the concept has been around for more than half a century, it has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various industries. Machine learning can be used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. It has also been applied in areas like marketing, where it can help with customer segmentation, personalization, and recommendation systems.",

    "summary": "Deep learning is the algorithm powering the current renaissance of artificial intelligence (AI). Its progress is not showing signs of slowing down. A McKinsey report estimates that by 2030, AI will potentially deliver $13 trillion to the global economy, or 16% of the world's current GDP. This opens up exciting career opportunities in the coming decade. However, deep learning can be daunting to learn. With the abundance of learning resources in recent years has emerged another problem - formation overload. This book aims to compress this knowledge and make the subject approachable. By the end of this book, you will be able to build a visual intuition about deep learning and neural networks.",
