# GitHub Pages AI Chat & Knowledge Graph Fixes

## Issues Fixed

This document outlines the critical fixes applied to make the document chat and knowledge graph AI connections work properly on GitHub Pages.

## üîß Problems Identified & Solutions

### 1. **CORS Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Ollama service connections from GitHub Pages (HTTPS) to localhost:11434 (HTTP) were failing due to CORS restrictions.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `mode: 'cors'` to all fetch requests
- Improved error handling with specific CORS error detection
- Enhanced user guidance for CORS configuration

### 2. **Environment Detection** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: GitHub Pages environment wasn't being detected correctly, causing suboptimal performance settings.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced environment detection in `src/config/environment.ts`
- Added detection for various hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- Improved HTTPS protocol detection for static hosting

### 3. **Error Handling** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: No proper error boundaries for AI connection failures, causing crashes.

**Solution**:
- Created `ErrorBoundary` component for graceful error handling
- Wrapped `DocumentChat` and `KnowledgeGraph` components with error boundaries
- Added detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps

### 4. **Service Timeouts** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: AI service timeouts were too aggressive, causing premature failures.

**Solution**:
- Increased timeout settings for GitHub Pages environment (5 minutes)
- Added exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Better timeout error messages with actionable advice

### 5. **Model Compatibility** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Embedding service only checked for Mistral models, ignoring other compatible models.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced model detection to support Llama, Phi3, and other models
- Added fallback embedding generation for offline scenarios
- Improved model recommendation based on system memory

## üöÄ How to Use the Fixed Version

### For Users (GitHub Pages)

1. **Visit the GitHub Pages site**: The application now works better on GitHub Pages with improved error handling.

2. **For AI Chat Features**:
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama locally
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   
   # Start Ollama with CORS enabled
   export OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"
   ollama serve
   
   # Install a compatible model
   ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct
   # OR for lower memory systems:
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b
   ```

3. **Test the connection**: Open any document and check the chat panel - you should see connection status.

### For Developers

The fixes are automatically applied when you deploy to GitHub Pages. Key improvements:

- **Better error messages**: Users get clear instructions when AI features fail
- **Graceful degradation**: App continues working even if AI services are unavailable
- **Performance optimization**: Automatic detection of hosting environment with appropriate settings

   - Retry functionality

5. **`src/components/PDFModal.tsx`**
   - Wrapped DocumentChat with ErrorBoundary
   - Added specific error handling for chat failures

6. **`src/components/DocumentLibraryWithGraph.tsx`**
   - Wrapped KnowledgeGraph with ErrorBoundary
   - Added error handling for graph generation failures

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå Silent failures when Ollama not connected
- ‚ùå Cryptic error messages
- ‚ùå App crashes when AI services fail
- ‚ùå No guidance for setup

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Clear connection status indicators
- ‚úÖ Detailed setup instructions in error messages
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
- ‚úÖ Automatic environment optimization

## üîç Testing the Fixes

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Ollama Not Running**:
   - Should show clear "Ollama Not Connected" message
   - Provides setup instructions
   - App continues to work for document viewing

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - Detects CORS errors specifically
   - Provides OLLAMA_ORIGINS configuration guidance
   - Shows retry connection option

3. **Model Not Available**:
   - Lists available models
   - Suggests model installation commands
   - Gracefully falls back to keyword-based features

4. **Network Timeouts**:
   - Shows progress indicators
   - Provides timeout feedback
   - Suggests simpler questions or model changes

## üìä Performance Optimizations

- **Memory-based model recommendations**: Automatically suggests appropriate models based on detected system memory
- **Timeout adjustments**: Longer timeouts for GitHub Pages environment (5 minutes vs 30 seconds)
- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for better reliability
- **Fallback systems**: Keyword-based embeddings when AI unavailable

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **"Ollama Not Connected"**
   ```bash
   # Check if Ollama is running
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   
   # If not running, start it
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **CORS Errors**
   ```bash
   # Stop Ollama
   # Set environment variable
   export OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"
   # Restart Ollama
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **No Models Found**
   ```bash
   # List available models
   ollama list
   
   # Install recommended model
   ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct
   ```

4. **Slow Responses**
   - Try smaller models: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
   - Close other applications to free memory
   - Ask simpler questions

## üîÑ Deployment Notes

These fixes are automatically applied when deploying to GitHub Pages. No additional configuration required for the hosting platform.

The application now:
- Detects GitHub Pages environment automatically
- Applies appropriate performance settings
- Provides better user guidance
- Handles errors gracefully
- Continues working even when AI features are unavailable

---

**Result**: The document chat and knowledge graph AI connections now work reliably on GitHub Pages with proper error handling and user guidance.
