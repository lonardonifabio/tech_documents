Private companies and \nresearch institutions capture terabytes of data about their users’ interactions, business, social \nmedia, and also sensors from devices such as mobile phones and automobiles. The challenge of \nthis era is to make sense of this sea of data. This is where big data analytics ..."

    "summary": "Decision Trees (DTs) are a supervised learning method used for classification and regression. They aim to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules from the data features. DTs have advantages such as simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, they also have limitations such as overfitting, instability, and difficulty in handling certain concepts.",
